#Program Prompt: Access the words.csv file and store the data to a dictionary, where each word in the file is a key of the dictionary and
#the value stored to each key is the wordâ€™s corresponding definition. Then, create a repeatable program that allows a 
#user to interact with the dictionary based on the following menu
