#PROGRAM PROMPT: This is a two-part program where you will work on creating and populating parallel lists based on file data, then create
#and write data to a file.

    #PART 1: Write a program that utilizes the got_emails.csv file. Store the file data into 1D parallel lists, then use the information in
    #the lists to assign additional data to each employee. Use the tables below to assign each employee in the file a unique
    #email address, a department, and a unique phone extension.

    #PART 2: Once you have completed populating all eight parallel lists and displaying the five required back to the user (and in the
    #same Python file), create and write the following data for each employee to a file named westeros.csv: first name, last
    #name, email, department, and phone extension. #Note: each employeeâ€™s data should be on its own record (row) within
    #he newly created file. You will most likely end up with an extra empty line at the end of the file (this is okay for this lab
    #as we will not be reprocessing the data found in this new file)
